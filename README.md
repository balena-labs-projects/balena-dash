Try our simple [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud) starter project to set up a Raspberry Pi and LCD or monitor to display any webpage or web-based dashboard. We’re creatively calling it balenaDash! Follow along with our guide to get up and running in under 30 minutes.


## Introduction

This is the perfect introductory project to try out [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud) and see how everything works.

At the most basic level, this project allows you to display any webpage using a lightweight web browser. This means that you can build a device dedicated to showing anything that runs in a normal web browser, it will boot up and automatically start displaying what you choose.

Some examples of what you could use this for include:

* [Instagram](https://instagram.com) photo stream (based on hashtag or user)
* Data-centric dashboards using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) or [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
* Live digital photo frame feeding from [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/)
* Display for services such as [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/) or  [Flightaware](https://flightaware.com/)
* Digital [fishtank](http://www.fishgl.com/) or [jellyfish](https://arodic.github.io/p/jellyfish/)
* Streaming webcam display
* 24 hour live [animated cat](http://www.nyan.cat/) display
* [Home automation](https://www.home-assistant.io) dashboard

## Hardware required

We’ve partnered with our friends at [PiSupply](https://pisupp.ly/) to make it easy for you to get ahold of all the hardware you need to build this project in a single package. We’ve created two packages, one that includes everything you’ll need, and a second that includes everything apart from the display for if you’ve already got a monitor you want to use.

* **[balenaDash kit](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/balenadash-kit)**
* **[balenaDash kit - barebones](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/balenadash-kit-barebones)**

The list of items you’ll need is also included below:

* Raspberry Pi 3B
* 16GB Micro-SD Card (we recommend Sandisk Extreme Pro SD cards)
* Display (any Raspberry Pi display will work for this project)
* Micro-USB cable
* Power supply
* Case (optional)
